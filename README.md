StackOverflow is a question and answer site for professional and enthusiast programmers. It is a privately-held website, the flagship site of the Stack Exchange Network, created in 2008 by Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky. It features questions and answers on a wide range of topics in computer programming. It was created to be a more open alternative to the earlier Q&A websites such as Experts-Exchange.

## About Survey
Every year, Stack Overflow conducts a massive survey of people on the site, covering all sorts of information like programming languages, salary, code style, and various other information. In the year 2017, they amassed more than 64,000 responses fielded from 213 countries.

## There are three questions which I wanted the answers of :
1. What was the distribution of student responders based on countries?
2. What were the famous programming languages between the students?
3. What was the mean salary of people from different Formal Education?
